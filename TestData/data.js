Visualization:  https://www.lucidchart.com/documents/view/d774e941-dcb7-4958-bd4a-319760d1d337/0_0
I have simplified a few things in this representation
1. reference 
    - from: a Firebase object 
    - to: "path/to/document"
2. date_created 
    - from: a Time object
    - to: a string
Note
1. I am using dev keyward to save JSON comment 
2. I have included some links to multimedia in dev for reference.
   I am not working on multimedia support for this sprint.
